## 📂 **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project includes player information from the **FIFA-19** game, with attributes such as:
- **Age**
- **Overall Rating**
- **Potential**
- **Position**
- **Value**
- **Wage**
- **Skill Levels**
- **Preferred Foot**

## 💻 **Installation**
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## 📝 **Data Analysis**
The analysis steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and formatting features appropriately.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examining the distribution of player attributes and relationships between key features such as age, overall rating, and value.

## 📊 **Visualizations**
Visualizations created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** include:
- **Distribution Plots**: To visualize the spread of player ratings, ages, and potential.
- **Heatmaps**: To identify correlations between different player attributes, such as skill levels and overall rating.
- **Boxplots and Violin Plots**: To compare different player groups based on factors like position and preferred foot.
- **Scatter Plots**: To explore relationships between players' value and their ratings.

## 🔍 **Insights**
From the visual analysis:
- **Age vs. Rating**: Younger players often have higher potential ratings, while older players may have higher current ratings but lower potential.
- **Position Impact**: Certain positions, like forwards, tend to have higher values and wages due to their impact on gameplay.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Strong correlations were found between overall rating and skill attributes, indicating that skill improvement directly impacts player ratings.

## 📝 **Conclusion**
This project showcases how data analysis and visualization techniques can provide valuable insights into player performance and attributes in **FIFA-19**. The findings highlight the importance of different features and their influence on player ratings and value.
